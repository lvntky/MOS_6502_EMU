Yet another MOS 6502 CPU Emulator, coded in C.

## What is 6502?

6502 is an 8-bit microprocessor that was designed by a small team led by Chuck Peddle for MOS Technology. The design team had formerly worked at Motorola on the Motorola 6800 project; the 6502 is essentially a simplified, less expensive and faster version of that design.

## Why to code a 6502 Emulator

Processors are one of the most important parts of computers. As a software developer, not knowing about these parts is unacceptable. I believe the best way to learn something is to get your hands dirty and do it, that's why I'm coding this project.
